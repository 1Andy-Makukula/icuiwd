# HTML Beginner Project
This is my first web development project for ICUIWD.
I used HTML to create a basic website with a heading, paragraph and examples from the topic like: 
-HTML Quotations
-HTML Comments
-HTML Colors
-HTML styles

I used Visual Studio Code to create this and I will push it to GitHub
